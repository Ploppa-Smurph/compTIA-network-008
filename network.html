<h2>01 Networking Concepts</h2>
<h3>01.01 OSI Model</h3>
    <b>Understanding the OSI</b>
        <b>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model</b>
            <b><i>Layer 1 = Physical</i></b> --> Bits, Hub;                             Protocols = not about protocols, about cabling
            <b><i>Layer 2 = Data Link</i></b> --> Frames; MAC Address, switching layer; Protocols = MAC address
            <b><i>Layer 3 = Network</i></b> --> Routing Layer; IP Addresses, Frames are fragmented before transport   Protocol = IP
            <b><i>Layer 4 = Transport</i></b> --> Post Office Layer;                    Protocols = TCP and UDP
            <b><i>Layer 5 = Session</i></b> --> Start and Stop communication; Control and Tunneling      Protocols = ?
            <b><i>Layer 6 = Presentation</i></b> --> Character encoding, encryption of application data  Protocols = SSL/TLS 
            <b><i>Layer 7 = Application</i></b> --> layer we see;                       Protocols = FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, IMAP

    <b>Data Communication</b>
        <b>Protocol Data Unit (PDU)</b> - aka 'Transmission Units'

        <b>Encapsulation and Decapsulation</b>
            Layer 5,6,7 (Application)  -                        App Data
            Layer 4     (Transport)    -             TCP Head - App Data
            Layer 3     (Network)      -   IP Head - TCP Head - App Data 
            Layer 2     (Data Link)    - Frame Head - IP Head - TCP Head - App Data - Frame Trailer

        Each layer has a 'Header' and 'Payload' 

        <b>TCP Flags</b> - part of the TCP header and contains important control information
            <i>SYN</i> - synchronize sequence
            <i>PSH</i> - push to application without buffering
            <i>RST</i> - reset connection
            <i>FIN</i> - last packet from sender

        <b>MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)</b> - Max IP packet to transmit without fragmenting
            Fragmentation slows transmission down, if you lose a fragment, you lose an entire packet; 
            ** with VPN the tunnel size may be smaller than the network's MTU size which can be a concern

<h3>01.02 Network Topologies and Types</h3>
    <b>Network Toplogies</b> - layout of network

<h3>01.04 IP Subnetting</h3>
    <b>Binary Math</b>
        <b>bit</b> - 0 or 1
        <b>byte</b> - 8 bits (an octect)
        
        <b>128    64    32     16     8      4      2       1</b> 

    <b>IPv4 Addressing</b> - layer 3 (OSI Layer 3)
        <b>IP Address</b>
        <b>Subnet Mask</b>
        <b>Default Gateway</b> - allows communication from inner network to outside

        <b>Loopback Address</b> - 127.0.0.1
        <b>Reserved Addresses</b>  = 240.0.0.1 - 254.255.255.254 -- these are 'Class E' addresses
        <b>VIP Address (Virtual IP)</b> - virtual machine IP

        -- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit (4 byte), max decimal value for each byte is 255

        <b>DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</b> - auto config IP address, gateway, and more
        <b>APIPA Automatic Private IP Address</b> aka 'Link Local Address' - 169.254.0.1
            cannot communicate with router or network, start with 169

    <b>Network Address Translation</b> - occurs in Router - changes inner network communication IP to public IP address when running through Router
        <b>NAT Network Address Translation</b> 

        <b>Private IP Addresses</b>
            <b><i>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255</i></b>     - Class A
            <b><i>172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255</i></b>   - Class B
            <b><i>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</i></b> - Class C

        <b>NAT Overload / Port Address Translation (PAT)</b> - 

    <b>Network Communication</b>
        <b>Unicast</b>   - one-to-one 

        <b>Multicast</b> - one-to-many; does not scale well across large networks

        <b>Broadcast</b> - one-to-all; limited to the 'Broadcast Domain'
            ARP is a type of IPv4 Broadcast, an ARP request is broadcast to all devices connected to broadcast domain

        <b>Anycast</b> - ?? DNS is a type of anycast ??

    <b>Classful Subnetting</b> - 
        <b>Class A</b> - Host 24; 1st octet = (001 - 127); subnet mask = 255.0.0.0
        <b>Class B</b> - Host 16; 1st octet = (128 - 191); subnet mask = 255.255.0.0
        <b>Class C</b> - Host 8;  1st octet = (192 - 223); subnet mask = 255.255.255.0 
        
        <b>Subnet parts: </b>
            <i>Network Address</i> - 1st part of the subnet
            <i>First Usable Host Address</i> = Network Address + 1 (1 more than network address)
            <i>Network Broadcast Address</i>
            <i>Last Usable Host Address</i> = Broadcast Address - 1 (1 less than broadcast address)

        ex: IPv4 10.74.222.11; class A w/ subnet of 255.0.0.0
             Network    = 10.0.0.0       -- for the network address set all host bits to 0 
             Host       = 74.222.11
             First Host = 10.0.0.1
             Broadcast  = 10.255.255.255 -- for broadcast set all host bits to 255
             Last Host  = 10.255.255.254

        ex2: 172.16.88.200; class B w/ subnet of 255.255.0.0
             Network    = 172.16.0.0 
             First Host = 172.16.0.1
             Broadcast  = 172.16.255.255 
             Last Host  = 172.16.255.254

    <b>IPv4 Subnet Masks</b>
        <b>CIDR Block Notation</b> - uses total bit from Network mask (how many octets start with 255 in subnet mask)
            ex: <i>255.255.255.0</i> is CIDR /24; whereas <i>255.0.0.0</i> would be CIDR /8
         CIDR Block Notation aka 'Slash Notation', aka 'Prefix Notation'

         <b>Binary to Decimal</b>
         00000000   =    0  
         10000000   =    128
         11000000   =    192
         11100000   =    224
         11110000   =    240
         11111000   =    248
         11111100   =    252
         11111110   =    254
         11111111   =    255

    <b>Calculating IPv4 Subnets and Hosts</b>
        <b>VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masks)</b> - classless; can customize subnet mask for specific networks

    <b>Magic Number Subnetting</b>

    <b>Seven Second Subnetting</b>


    <b>IPv6 Addressing</b> - 128-bit (16 byte) 
        - seperated by ":" ex: fe80:0000:0000:0000:5d18:0652:cffd:8f52
                           shortened     fe80::5d18:652:cffd:8f52

        - groups of zeros can be abbreviated with double colon, only one abbreviation per address
        - leading zeros are optional

                         ex: 2600:DDDD:1111:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001 
        remove leading zero: 2600:DDDD:1111:   1:   0:   0:   0:   1
        remove group zero  : 2600:DDDD:1111:1::1

        <b>EUI-64</b> aka Extended Unique Identifier
            use MAC address (48-bit) as 64-bit EUI-64
                1st 3 bytes (24-bits) = OUI Organizationally Unique Id
                2nd 3 bytes           = Network Interface Controller Specific S/N
                add FFFE in the middle

    <b>IPv6 Subnet Masks</b> - IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority = 

    <b>Configuring IPv6</b>

        <b>4in6</b>
        <b>Teredo / Miredo</b> - temporary communication
        <b>Dual-Stack routing</b>

        <b>Orchestration</b> - applications can be instantly provisioned

        <b>VPN Virtual Private Network</b> - encrypts communication 

        <b>VM Sprawl</b> - created too many systems; you should always have a process for provisioning and deprovisioning devices

            <i>Speed</i>
            <i>Distance</i>
            <i><b>RSSI Recived Signal Strength Indication</b></i> - measured dBm (decibel per milliwatt)
                - negative number on a log scale; closest to 0 is better
            <i>Wireless Survey Tool</i> or a spectrum analyzer
            <i>EIRP</i> - Effective Isotropic Radiated Power, regulated amount
            <i>Omnidirectional</i> - aka rubber duck antenna
